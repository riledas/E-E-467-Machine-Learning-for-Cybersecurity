# EE 467 – Machine Learning for Cybersecurity

This repository contains coursework and lab projects from EE 467 (Machine Learning for Cybersecurity).  
The work focuses on applying machine learning techniques to analyze data, detect anomalous behavior, and evaluate model performance in security-related contexts.

## Overview

Throughout this course, I implemented and evaluated machine learning models within provided frameworks, performed feature engineering, and analyzed results using Python-based data science tools. The labs emphasize practical ML workflows, including preprocessing, model training, validation, and visualization.

Topics covered include:
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices)
- Anomaly detection concepts
- Security-focused applications of machine learning
